Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Problem Description
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade according to the following criteria:

A: Greater than 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 59 to 49
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40
Steps Taken
Defined a JavaScript function calculateGrade() to handle the logic.
Used prompt() to get the student's mark as input.
Checked if the input is valid (between 0 and 100).
Determined the grade based on the specified grade ranges.
Displayed the result to the user.
Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Problem Description
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "License suspended".

Steps Taken
Created a JavaScript function speedDetector(speed) to handle the logic.
Defined constants for speed limit, km per demerit point, and maximum demerit points.
Checked if the speed is within the speed limit or exceeded.
Calculated the number of demerit points based on the speed.
Displayed the result to the user, considering license suspension if needed.
Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Problem Description
Write a program that calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

Steps Taken
Created a JavaScript program to calculate the individual's net salary.
Collected inputs for basic salary and benefits.
Calculated payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary using specified formulas.
